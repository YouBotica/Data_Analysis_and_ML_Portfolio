Machine learning has two main types:

1. Supervised learning: predicting an output.
2. Unsupervised learning: Discover patterns in data.


Why Machine Learning?

-ML in general is the study of  statistical computer algorithms, that improve automatically through data.
-Unlike typical computer algorithms that rely on human input, ML algorithms infer the best approach from the data itself.
-ML is a subset of artificial intelligence.
-ML algorithms are not explicitly programmed on which decisions to make.
-Instead, the ML algorithm is designed to infer from the data the optimal choices to make.

Structure of ML problems:
    - Given features from a data set, obtain a certain label.
    - These algorithms are generally called estimators, since they estimate outputs or labels.

Simple example:
    - Predict the price of a house should sell at given its current features. (Area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.)
    - A typical algorithm will depend on a human to manually set values of importance (weights) for each feature.


There is a caveat: we need good data!


TYPES OF ML:

1. Supervised Learning: It requires historical and label data to be able to predict a value.
    -Historical data: known 
    -Labeled: The desired output is known.  
    
    Two main label types:
        1. Categorical value to predict:
            - Classification task.
        2. Continuous value to predict:
            - Regression task.
    

2. Unsupervised Learning: Applied to unlabeled data, the ML model discovers possible patterns in the data.
- Group and interpret data without a label.
- Since there is no historical "correct" label, it is much harder to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
