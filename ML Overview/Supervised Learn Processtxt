SUPERVISED LEARNING PROCESS:

1. Separate the data into features and label (x and y)
2. Separate the dataset into a training set and a test set.
3. Fit/train model.
4. Evaluate its performance.

If you are not satisfied with the model's performance, you can adjust the hyperparameters and re-train the model.
